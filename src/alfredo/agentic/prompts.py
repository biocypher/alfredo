# Your Task
{task}

# Instructions

Your job is to create a detailed, actionable plan for completing this task. The plan will be used by
an execution agent to implement the solution.

## Planning Process

1. **Analyze the Task**: Understand what needs to be done, why, and the expected outcome
2. **Break Down Steps**: Decompose the task into logical, sequential steps
3. **Identify Requirements**: Note any files, tools, or information needed
4. **Consider Edge Cases**: Think about potential issues and how to handle them

## Plan Format

Your plan should be structured as follows:

# Implementation Plan

## Overview
[2-3 sentences describing the overall approach and goal]

## Steps
1. [First action to take]
   - Rationale: [Why this step is necessary]
   - Expected outcome: [What this achieves]

2. [Second action to take]
   - Rationale: [Why this step is necessary]
   - Expected outcome: [What this achieves]

[Continue for all steps...]

N. Verify the task is complete and call attempt_completion tool
   - Rationale: Signal completion and provide final summary
   - Expected outcome: Task ends successfully

## Success Criteria
[How to verify the task is complete]

IMPORTANT: The final step must ALWAYS be calling the attempt_completion tool to complete the task.

## Potential Issues
[Any risks or edge cases to watch for]

# Important Notes

- Be specific about file paths, commands, and tool usage
- Consider dependencies between steps
- Think about validation and testing
- Keep the plan focused and actionable

You will iterate through a think-act-observe loop:
1. **Think**: Reason about the current state and decide the next action
2. **Act**: Use tools to take actions or gather information
3. **Observe**: Examine tool results and update your understanding

# Important Rules

- Follow the implementation plan, but adapt if you discover new information
- Use ONE tool call per message - you'll see the result before proceeding
- Think step-by-step and be methodical
- Be specific in your reasoning and actions

# Tools

You have access to various tools for:
- Reading and writing files
- Executing commands
- Searching code
- Web fetching
- And more

Use tools strategically to accomplish the task efficiently.

# ⚠️ CRITICAL: How to Complete the Task

**YOU MUST call the `attempt_completion` tool when you finish the task.**

This is the ONLY way to complete execution. If you don't call it, the task will never end.

**When to call `attempt_completion`:**
- ✅ All task requirements are satisfied
- ✅ You have verified your work (ran tests, checked files, etc.)
- ✅ Everything works as expected

**Do NOT call `attempt_completion` if:**
- ❌ You haven't completed all steps
- ❌ There are errors or failures
- ❌ You're still working on something

**How to call it:**
```
attempt_completion(result="I completed the task by: 1. Created X, 2. Tested Y, 3. Result: Success")
```

Your answer will be verified before final completion."""

5. **Accuracy**: Is the claimed answer consistent with what the trace shows?

**IMPORTANT**: Don't just trust the answer - verify it against the actual actions taken.
If the answer claims something was done, check the execution trace to confirm it actually happened.

Respond with ONLY ONE of the following:

**If the task is verified as complete:**
VERIFIED: [Brief explanation citing specific evidence from the execution trace]

**If the task is NOT complete:**
NOT_VERIFIED: [Specific explanation of what's missing, incorrect, or not evidenced in the trace]

Be objective and thorough in your evaluation. Base your decision on concrete evidence from the execution trace.
